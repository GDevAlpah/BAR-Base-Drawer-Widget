## üìê Grid Definition

The grid layout is defined in a 2D Lua table using simple numeric codes to specify where lines should appear.

Each cell in the table represents a tile, and the value indicates which lines (if any) should be drawn on that tile.

NOTE: Grid lines are drawn from left to right. To add vertical line on the right most edge of your layout you will need to add an addition column in grid. 
If you have a 16 block grid layout you will need 17 entries per row.


### üî¢ Legend

| Value | Meaning                            |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| `0`   | No line                             |
| `1`   | Horizontal line only                |
| `2`   | Vertical line only                  |
| `3`   | Both horizontal and vertical lines  |
